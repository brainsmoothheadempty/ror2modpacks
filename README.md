## Using the Modpacks
Latest versions of modpacks can be retrieved by navigating to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/brainsmoothheadempty/ror2modpacks/tags), selecting the relevant modpack, and downloading the .r2z file.
The .r2z file can then be easily imported into r2modman.

To setup and import r2modman and import the modpacks, follow these steps:

1. Download r2modman from [this link](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/).
2. Extract the download anywhere and run the setup executable.
3. Launch r2modman and select Risk of Rain 2 as your game. I recommend starring it and setting it as default.

8. You should now see the following screen, with a list of installed mods. If you see a message about updating mods, click the message to update them all. When you want to play, ensure you are logged into Steam, then click the `Start modded` button in r2modman. Give it tiem to load, as it can take a while to startup for large modpacks. You can safely close the BepInEx log window when the game launches.

  - Yes, all progression should be maintained between modded and unmodded versions of the game.
