## Using the Modpacks
Latest versions of modpacks can be retrieved by navigating to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/brainsmoothheadempty/ror2modpacks/tags), selecting the relevant modpack, and grabbing the code.
The  modpack can then be easily imported into r2modman.

To setup and r2modman and import the modpacks, follow these steps:

1. Download r2modman from [this link](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/).
2. Extract the download anywhere and run the setup executable.
3. Launch r2modman and select Risk of Rain 2 as your game. I recommend starring it and setting it as default.

8. You should now see the following screen, with a list of installed mods. If you see a message about updating mods, click the message to update them all. When you want to play, ensure you are logged into Steam, then click the `Start modded` button in r2modman. Give it time to load, as it can take a while to finish startup for large modpacks. You can safely close the BepInEx log window when the game launches.

## FAQ
- Will Steam achievements still work with mods?
  - Yes, all Steam achievements will still be earnable while using mods, except in rare cases for certain mods (which we don't use) that unlock all items, as this removes the achievement trigger event.
- Will my progress be maintained between vanilla and modded versions of Risk of Rain 2?
  - Yes, all progression should be maintained between modded and unmodded versions of the game.
